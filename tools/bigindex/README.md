# Big Graphite custom index for Cassandra

Custom Lucene-based index that supports selecting metric names using the
Graphite globbing syntax. It takes inspiration (and some code) from the
Cassandra implementation of SSTable-attached secondary indices (SASI) and
follows the same lifecycle.

## TODO
- How to build?
- How to deploy?
